		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Powdered Milk: 1 Cup</li>
			<li>All Purpose Flour: 2 Tablespoons</li>
			<li>Semolina: 1 Tablespoon</li>
			<li>Baking Powder: 1 Teaspoon</li>
			<li>Ghee [Clarified Butter]: 1/2 Tablespoon</li>
			<li>Milk: 1/2 Cup</li>
			<li>Red Food Color: 2-3 Drops</li>
			<li>Water: 3 Cups</li>
			<li>Sugar: 2 Cups</li>
			<li>Green Cardamom: 3 pieces</li>
			<li>Vegetable Virgin Oil: As Needed</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Take a large round bowl, and add <strong>Powdered Milk</strong>,
				<strong>All Purpose Flour</strong>, <strong>Semolina</strong>,
				<strong>Baking Powder</strong>, and mix well.
			</li>
			<li>
				After the initial mixing is done, add the <strong>Ghee</strong> and mix
				well again.
			</li>
			<li>
				Slowly add the <strong>Milk</strong>, one tablespoon at a time, and mix
				well each time. Wait a few seconds before adding the next spoon of milk
				while continuously mixing the whole time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the <strong>Food Color</strong>, and continue mixing until the
				mixture becomes really sticky.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use some <strong>Ghee</strong> on your hands, spreading it nicely. Then
				carefully take a small portion of the mixture and shape it.
			</li>
			<li>
				First, roll the portion into a ball using your hands, and then slowly
				press the palms of your hands together, so that the portion turns into a
				sort of cylinder shape.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a separate large pan, heat the <strong>Water</strong>,
				<strong>Sugar</strong>, and <strong>Cardamoms</strong>, stirring with a
				long teaspoon, until the sugar dissolves. Keep this sugar mixture hot.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a non-stick frying pan, use <strong>Vegetable Virgin Oil</strong> to
				coat the surface, and with a bit more oil, fry the cylinder-shaped sweet
				mixtures on low-medium heat.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Use a wooden spoon</em> to slowly roll the mixtures so they cook
				evenly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the sweets turn reddish-black, soak them in the sugar mixture you
				made earlier and
				<em>leave them in it for at least <strong>6 hours!</strong></em>
			</li>
			<li>Finally, after waiting long enough, eat and enjoy!</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Final Words:</h2>
		<p>
			This recipe, holds a special place in my mind as this was the last dish I
			made, which my mother had the chance to try, before she passed away in
			2022. May Allah bless her soul! I hope you will try this dish and enjoy
			the sweetness of Kalo Jams!

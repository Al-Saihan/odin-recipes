Hey There! I see, you have taken an interest in my first ever "Public Web Project"!

Be prepared to have your eyes rot, because this is going to be highly beginner level!

Hopefully, I will come back later in the future, when I have learned a bit more and update this website to look even more prettier!

Till then, Win Thy Luck!~
